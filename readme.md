To launch the simulation, run the INIT_FULL.m
An interface will open allowing you to launch the simulation using the simulink benchmark.
You will be able to chose the scenario as well as different parameters if you want to.
To observe the curves, you will have to go to the simulink file (CHEM_FULL_BENCHMRK.slx) and open the corresponding scope.
